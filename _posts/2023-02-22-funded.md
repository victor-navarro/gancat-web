# Breaking ground

The creation of this website marks the beginning of the GANCAT project. On 02/13/2023, the results for the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions postdoctoral fellowship came through, bearing good news and an impressing evaluation score (98/100). After a successful application, the grant agreement process begins.

Stay tuned.
